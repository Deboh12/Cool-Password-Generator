# Cool-Password-Generator

## Link to Deployed Application

## Description

I created this project to build a simple yet effective password generator. The motivation behind it was to provide users with a tool to generate secure passwords based on their preferences. It solves the problem of creating strong, unique passwords for different accounts. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in JavaScript and improved my understanding of randomization and string manipulation.

## Usage

To use The Cool Password Generator, open the webpage and follow these steps:

1. Enter the desired password length between 8 and 128 characters.

3. Click the "Generate Password" button.
The generated password will be displayed in the designated area on the page. You can then copy and use it for your accounts.

## Features

JavaScript Features Used:

1. Functions: Defined functions to encapsulate code for specific tasks, enhancing modularity and readability.

2. Conditionals (if statements): Used conditional statements to check and validate user inputs, ensuring the selected options meet the requirements.

3. Prompt and Confirm: Utilized the prompt function to gather user input for password length and the confirm function to confirm password preferences.

4. Randomization: Applied the Math.random() function to generate random indices for selecting characters from the combined character set.

5. String Manipulation: Combined character sets based on user preferences and concatenated characters to build the final password.
